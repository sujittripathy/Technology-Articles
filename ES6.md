* let and const
* const
* hoisting with let and const
  * declaring the constants and variable before accessing it.
* Arrow Functions
* Arrow function and 'this'
  * In arrow function 'this' doesn't change the context from which it's being called.
* Default parameters
  * default value can be given to the function argument. If the parameter is not passed then default value will be used.
* Object literal extension
  * objects can take the value from outside of the block. This is something useful to initialize the objects by defining once on top and
    all the objects refer to the same.
* Rest operator (...) and spread operator
  * This is for passing dynamic arguments to the parameter. The value in parameter starts as '...'.
  * spread operator convert the array to a list which is kind of opposite of rest.
* For-of-Loop
  * looping thru -> for(let res of testResults)
* Template Literals
  * multi line string can be defined with backtick.
* Destructuring Arrays
  * Extract values from an array in an quick way, let [a,b,c,f] = numbers;
  * it presents on the left side of the equal side to extract the value.
* Destructuring Objects
  * Extracting values from objects, similar as arrays
  * to rename the variable use alias so, outside the object it can be referred as a different name, greet:hello
